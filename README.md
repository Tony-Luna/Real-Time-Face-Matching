# Real-Time Face Recognition System

This project presents a real-time face recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch. It utilizes a pre-trained model from the `facenet_pytorch` library to generate embeddings from face images, which are then stored in a SQLite database. During real-time recognition, the system matches the face embeddings with the stored embeddings to identify individuals.

## Features
- Face Embedding Generation
- Real-Time Face Recognition
- SQLite Database Integration

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-face-recognition.git
cd real-time-face-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the following script to generate face embeddings from a dataset of images:
```bash
python generate_embeddings.py
Run the script below for real-time face recognition:
```bash
python real_time_recognition.py

## Database Schema
Refer to Diagram 1 for the SQLite database schema used to store face embeddings.

## Face Recognition Workflow
Refer to Diagram 2 for the workflow of the real-time face recognition system.
