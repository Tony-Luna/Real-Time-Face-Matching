# Real-Time Face Recognition System

This project presents a real-time face recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch. It utilizes a pre-trained model from the `facenet_pytorch` library to generate embeddings from face images, which are then stored in a SQLite database. During real-time recognition, the system matches the face embeddings with the stored embeddings to identify individuals.
